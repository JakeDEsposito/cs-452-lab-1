# Contributions

## Jake D'Esposito

I wrote the code for drawing the shapes. Also, I wrote code to abstract aspects of the program such as binding data to the buffer and creating circles. I modified the fragment shader to allow for switching out the color for each object without the need for a new fragment shader.

## Ethan Arnold

I contributed to implementing the algorithm efficiently. I also helped debug graphical errors. I made sure the ellipse was aspect ratio corrected in coordinate space.
